Shop Billing System is based on the concept of generating the total bill of a shoping transaction. 

It contains an admin login system (predefined password). The admin can easily manage and view all the transactions. 

This project contains limited features, but the essential one.

Talking about the features of the Shop Billing system, the user can generate a total bill of an item by entering the number of items, name, quantity, and price per item. After all this, the system generates a total amount with adding Taxes (0.03 for price<=100 and 0.12 for price>100) and asks for the amount paid and displays the total return amount to the user. The last feature includes a list of all transactions with transaction id.

The system creates an external file to store the data permanently. The shop Billing system is developed using C++ Programming Language and different variables, strings have been used for the development of it. This project provides the simplest system for management of shop billings.
